comments i don't understand:



 Constructor doesn't give values to counter or player

Actor: how does resetDirection differ for Player vs. Monster (i.e. why is it pure virtual?)

Monster: why is isOnPlayer() pure virtual? Wouldn't that be the same for any Monster? I would
 suggest storing a display char in Monster so that getDisplayChar can be implemented here instead of 4 times. 
No need for 3 bools for the state, since no two of them could ever be true at the same time. Probably easier as
 a single int or string. Constructor doesn't give values to counter or player. Why is setVulnerable and setNormal 
virtual? They should be the same for all Monsters (the movement is different, but the setting of the states is not). 
How would setVulnerable be called? The Player eats the power pellet but has no way to tell Monsters or the Game it 
did so. level issues for vulnerable count is probably easier done as a parameter to setVulnerable. Monster will 
probably only need the Player pointer to determine its x,y for smart algorithms (or have getPlayer X/Yin Game).

Game: getMazeContents: unlikely this will have anything to do with Monsters. Remember that printing an I on the 
screen doesn't change the Maze to say that Inky is there. Furthermore if you did change the Maze contents you could
 lose the pellet that had been there. Since Actor has a Maze *, what is the need for getMazeContents at all?

Maze: DFSarray is easier as int than char. How will the Maze displayActors? It doesn't know anything about them 
(that method was just for the lab).

Player: How will the Player deter

player/monster algo: problems with your check on what state the monster is: your algorithm to determine if 
Player/Monster are on the same spot seems to assume there is only 1 Monster and so it can't check the state in 
the next if. You will have to do this twice per tick: once after the Player moves and then again after 
all 4 Monsters have moved (or possibly after each Monster moved).

Dinky: invisibility would be considered cheating. That isn't making him smarter, that is giving him special 
abilities/powers. Having him able to see the whole map isn't really a complete idea. Now that he knows the
 map, what will he do?
